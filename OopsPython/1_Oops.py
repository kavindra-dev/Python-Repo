#In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.

# It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.

#OOPs Concepts in Python :
#1. Class : A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
#           Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
#               Syntax =>  class ClassName :
                                #statement
#2. Objects : An Object is an instance of a Class. 
#             A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
#             An object consists of:
#               State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
#               Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
#               Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
#          Syntax => obj = ClassName()                 #object or instance of previously defined class is created.
#                    print(obj.atrr)                 #attr is some function or variable in the class that we are printing


#** The Python self  : Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition.
                    #** If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument i.e; self.


#3. Polymorphism :  The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
#                   In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) 
#                      being used for different types

#            Syntax => def add(x,y,z =0):
#               return x + y + z

#               print(add(2,3))

#4. Encapsulation
#5. Inheritance
#6. Data Abstraction
